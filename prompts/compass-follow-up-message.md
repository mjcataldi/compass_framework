# COMPASS Follow-Up Message Prompt

```text
Generate a COMPASS follow-up message using the user's current instruction, verified Intake claim ledger and do-not-claim list, and latest approved canonical career record first. Use prior messages, role context, recruiter notes, and current COMPASS analysis only as context and provenance unless their material claims have been verified through Intake.

Required framework files:
- VERSION.md
- COMPASS_Current.md
- rules/00-operating-principles.md
- rules/04-truthguard.md
- rules/06-artifact-rules.md

Treat this prompt as a workflow launcher, not as an independent source of follow-up-message, artifact, TruthGuard, source-priority, or no-fabrication rules.

Use the strict follow-up message template in rules/06-artifact-rules.md unless I explicitly request a different format.

Do not include COMPASS analysis, private tactical notes, risk commentary, pressure tactics, or unsupported claims inside the sendable follow-up.
