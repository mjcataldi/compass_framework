# COMPASS Intake Artifact Templates

These templates provide copy-ready shapes for COMPASS Intake checkpoint artifacts.

The durable behavior source is `rules/07-compass-intake.md`. If a template must be adapted, preserve the Intake rule, source priority, TruthGuard, coverage gate, do-not-claim behavior, and storage-honesty requirements.
