# 06 — Artifact Rules

This file defines COMPASS artifact behavior.

## Artifact Types

COMPASS may generate canonical career records, claim ledgers, analysis reports, tailored resumes, recruiter-targeted resumes, cover letters, recruiter responses, application answers, follow-up messages, interview preparation notes, compensation notes, and other career-specific artifacts.

## Separation Rule

Generated artifacts must be clean deliverables. Do not include internal COMPASS analysis in the artifact unless the user explicitly requests an internal dossier.

Generated artifacts are downstream outputs, not factual authorities. Do not use an old resume, cover letter, recruiter message, LinkedIn draft, application answer, or portfolio draft as source truth unless it has been separately imported, extracted, reconciled, and verified through COMPASS Intake.

## Page Authority

When a user specifies a page length or page limit for a DOCX-style artifact, the page count refers to the rendered Word/DOCX artifact using the relevant formatting standard.

If DOCX generation or page validation is unavailable, say so clearly and do not claim a verified page count.

## Naming Guidance

Use names that are clear and sortable.

Recommended patterns:

- `Candidate Name - Company - Role Title - YYYY-MM`
- `Candidate Name - Staff Engineer - Tailored for Recruiter Name - MM-YYYY`
- `Project Name - Artifact Type - YYYY-MM`
- `Organization - Strategy Memo - YYYY-MM`
- `Topic - Research Plan - YYYY-MM`

## Reviewability

Generated artifacts should be easy for the user to inspect, copy, revise, and reuse.
