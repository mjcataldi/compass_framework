# COMPASS Framework

COMPASS is a general-purpose, source-grounded framework for turning messy inputs into verified, defensible outputs.

COMPASS stands for:

> Capture, Organize, Map, Probe, Approve, Synthesize, Store

The framework is designed to answer a reusable question across domains:

> Can a reviewer quickly understand the value, evidence, risks, assumptions, and defensible next action?

COMPASS is the canonical framework. New work should use COMPASS terminology and canonical files.

## Canonical Source Files

Use these files as the active source of truth:

- `VERSION.md` — current framework version and status
- `COMPASS_Current.md` — canonical active framework definition
- `COMPASS_Changelog.md` — framework change history
- `rules/` — durable behavior rules
- `rules/07-source-of-truth-onboarding.md` — Layer 0 source-of-truth onboarding and claim verification rules
- `prompts/` — reusable prompt templates
- `prompts/compass-layer0-source-of-truth.md` — reusable Layer 0 onboarding launcher prompt
- `examples/` — example output patterns

Compatibility shims for earlier naming have been removed. Prompt templates and rule files should use COMPASS terminology only.

## Layer 0 Source-of-Truth Onboarding

Layer 0 is COMPASS's verified source-of-truth onboarding workflow.

Use Layer 0 when a new person, project, product idea, research initiative, career record, consulting deliverable, grant proposal, strategy document, or other knowledge domain needs a durable source of truth.

Layer 0 accepts source documents such as prior drafts, notes, resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn exports, product briefs, project notes, research material, performance reviews, certification records, meeting notes, architecture documents, strategy memos, or other reference material. These sources are treated as evidence leads, not automatic truth.

Default setup for non-technical users:

1. Create a Google Drive folder named `COMPASS Source of Truth`.
2. Add useful source documents to that folder.
3. Copy the folder link.
4. Add the folder link to the ChatGPT Project sources.
5. Start Layer 0 using `prompts/compass-layer0-source-of-truth.md`.

GitHub remains optional for end users. Technical users may fork this repository or maintain their own optimized COMPASS framework source.

Layer 0 must support pause/resume behavior. Users may say `I need a break`, `pause`, `bookmark this`, or `let's continue later`; COMPASS should stop asking new questions and emit a checkpoint that can be resumed later.

Layer 0 storage behavior must be honest:

- If direct Google Drive write/update access is available, save or update the Layer 0 source-of-truth files in the user's selected folder.
- If direct write/update access is not available, produce copy-ready files and clearly tell the user what to save where.
- Never claim that files were saved when they were only generated in chat.

## Domain Profiles

COMPASS is field-agnostic. Domain profiles may specialize the core workflow for particular use cases.

Initial domain profile:

- Careers / job-search profile: role evaluation, hiring-manager scan optimization, ATS and semantic alignment, master CV claim-ledger construction, truth-preserving resume tailoring, cover letters, recruiter-specific positioning, compensation and remote-work risk analysis, interview objection prediction, and evidence mapping from source records to job descriptions.

## Branch Policy

The `main` branch is canonical.

Anything merged to `main` is considered the active COMPASS framework unless an instruction explicitly points to another branch, tag, or commit.

## Memory and Context Policy

ChatGPT memory may contain user preferences, but this repository should override memory for COMPASS behavior when there is a conflict.

If repository access fails, the assistant should say so clearly and should not reconstruct COMPASS rules from memory unless explicitly authorized.

## Source-of-Truth Policy

COMPASS outputs must use the latest approved source-of-truth record, verified Layer 0 claim ledger when available, do-not-claim list when available, or user-provided source material for the session.

COMPASS must not invent technologies, ownership, certifications, credentials, metrics, employers, responsibilities, project history, product claims, research findings, business outcomes, or other domain claims.
